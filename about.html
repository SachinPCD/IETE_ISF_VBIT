            <p>Sowparnika, the flagship event of IETE-ISF VBIT , embarked on its journey a decade ago with a distinct focus on fostering innovation and creativity among first-year students. This event serves as a platform for these budding minds to showcase their ideas and talents through a variety of engaging activities, including working models, poster presentations, and quizzes. The primary objective is to encourage active participation and skill development as part of the outcome-based education approach.

              Over the past few years, Sowparnika has taken on a new dimension, being successfully organized by the IETE-ISF (Institution of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers - Industry Specific Focus) VBIT in collaboration with the esteemed departments of physics and chemistry. This collaborative effort has added depth and diversity to the event, allowing students to explore interdisciplinary approaches to their projects.
              
              The unique nature of Sowparnika holds special significance within the college community, particularly for first-year students. It serves as a stepping stone for them to delve into the world of academic and practical exploration, bridging theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience. The event has become an integral part of the academic calendar, creating an atmosphere of enthusiasm and camaraderie among the student body.
              
              As a testament to its success, Sowparnika has evolved into more than just a competition; it has become a symbol of innovation, collaboration, and academic excellence. The continued partnership with the departments of physics and chemistry underscores the commitment to a holistic educational experience, providing students with opportunities to apply classroom knowledge in real-world scenarios.
              
              Within the lively academic landscape of Vignana Bharathi Institute of Technology, Sowparnika is a much anticipated and treasured event because it is at the  core of a celebration of ideas, innovation, and the collaborative spirit of learning.</p>
